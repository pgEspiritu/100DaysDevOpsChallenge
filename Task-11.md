## ‚úÖ Task: Install and Configure Tomcat Server

```text
The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications,
which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting,
they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 3.
b. Configure it to run on port 8086.
c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.

Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp03:8086
````
---

### üìù Task Description

On **App Server 3**:

1. Install **Tomcat**.
2. Configure it to run on port **8086**.
3. Deploy `ROOT.war` (found on Jump Host at `/tmp`) so the webpage works at:

```bash
curl http://stapp03:8086
```

---

### üîÅ Step 1: SSH into App Server 3

From the jump host, connect to App Server 2:
```bash
ssh banner@stapp03
```
- `banner` ‚Äì username
- `stapp03` ‚Äì hostname of App Server 2

Enter the password when prompted:
```bash

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Tomcat Port

Edit Tomcat‚Äôs server configuration file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
```

### Description

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sudo` | Runs the command with superuser privileges, required because `/etc/tomcat/server.xml` is a system file. |
| `vi` | Opens the Vi text editor to view and edit files in the terminal. |
| `/etc/tomcat/server.xml` | The main configuration file for Apache Tomcat, containing settings for server ports, connectors, services, and hosts. |

| `sudo` | Runs the command with superuser privileges, required because `/usr/share/tomcat` is a system directory. |
| `mkdir` | Creates a new directory. |
| `-p` | Creates parent directories if they don‚Äôt already exist (prevents errors if part of the path is missing). |
| `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps` | The target directory for Tomcat‚Äôs deployed web applications. |

**Purpose:**
This command ensures the `webapps` directory exists under `/usr/share/tomcat`, creating any missing parent folders. This is the location where Tomcat stores and serves deployed web applications.

---

### üì¶ Step 5: Copy and Deploy ROOT.war
From the Jump Host, copy the `ROOT.war` file to App Server 2:

On Jump Host:

```bash
scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp/
```

| `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` | The target directory for removal, which is the extracted Tomcat ROOT application.           |

**purpose:**
This command forcefully deletes the Tomcat ROOT application directory and all its contents, commonly used when redeploying a new version of the application.

```bash
sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
```

### Description

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sudo` | Runs the command with superuser privileges, required because `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps` is a system directory. |
| `mv` | Moves or renames files and directories. |
| `/tmp/ROOT.war` | The source file to be moved (WAR file currently in the `/tmp` directory). |
| `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/` | The destination directory where Tomcat serves deployed applications. |

**Purpose:**
This command moves the `ROOT.war` file from the local `/tmp` directory to Tomcat‚Äôs `webapps` directory, making it available for deployment.

check if file is extracted
```bash
ls -l /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
```
> You should see both ROOT.war and a ROOT/ directory after Tomcat restarts.

since the output shown:
```text
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 banner banner 4529 Aug 14 10:58 ROOT.war
drwxr-xr-x 16 root   root   4096 Aug 14 10:52 docs
drwxr-xr-x  6 root   tomcat 4096 Aug 14 10:52 host-manager
drwxr-xr-x  6 root   tomcat 4096 Aug 14 10:52 manager
```
> your ROOT.war is owned by tomcat:tomcat, then it is correct if not,
> If it is owned by banner:banner but Tomcat runs under the tomcat user. That means Tomcat might not be able to properly extract or serve the .war file, causing the ‚Äúapplication is not setup correctly‚Äù issue.

fix it:
  a. Give the Tomcat user ownership of the .war and extracted directory:
  ```bash
  sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
  sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
  ```
  ### Description

  | Part | Description |
  |------|-------------|
  | `sudo` | Runs the command with superuser privileges, required to modify system files. |
  | `chown tomcat:tomcat` | Sets the owner to `tomcat` and the group to `tomcat`. |
  | `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war` | The WAR file for the Tomcat ROOT application. |
  | `chmod 644` | Sets the file permissions to read/write for owner, and read-only for group and others. |


  **Purpose:**
  The first command ensures the ROOT.war file is owned by the Tomcat user and group, and the second 
  command sets safe permissions so that Tomcat can read the file while preventing unauthorized modifications by other users.

### üì¶ Step 6: Check JAVA Version
> If the ROOT.war was compiled for Java 11+ but the system uses Java 1.8, it won‚Äôt deploy correctly:

```bash
java -version
```
If needed, install a compatible JDK:

```bash
sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk
```
